                I love the way that my life has changed becasue of the religion I believe in. <br>
                I love believing in a gospel, a Savior and a Heavenly Father that love us no matter what. <br> 
                I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to repent and be completely forgiven. <br>
                I love going forward and putting effort into my life.<br>
                I know that as I study on the word of God daily I can strengthen my faith and gain deeper relationship with Jesus Christ and my Heavenly Father. <br>
                I also know that as I practice these habits everyday I will be able to be an example to my future family and help raise my kids on the importance of having a strong foundation.
